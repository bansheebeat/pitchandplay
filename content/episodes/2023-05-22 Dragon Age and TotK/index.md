This week on Pitch & Play we change up the format a little! We check in on Cassie's progress on *Dragon Age: Origins*, which is about a third of the way through (Alistair is the worst). We then turn our attention to *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom*, discussing our feelings on *Breath of the Wild* and our very early impressions on how the sequel remedies much of our pain points with it.
