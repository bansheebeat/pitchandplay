This week on Pitch & Play, Cassie abuses her privileges of forcing others to play games she likes by making Ross play *Tony Hawk's American Wasteland* and relives her childhood fantasies of being a cool skateboarder instead of a boring adult. Ross and Cassie dig into the (admittedly sparse) narrative, at times bloated gameplay, and dope soundtrack (can you guess who writes these summaries?). Ross then pitches *Dragon Age Origins* to Cassie. Our pitch for *Dragon Age* is extra long as Cassie and Ross attempt to tease out the "best" way to approach a large BioWare RPG â€” especially one that has been a long time coming for Cassie.
