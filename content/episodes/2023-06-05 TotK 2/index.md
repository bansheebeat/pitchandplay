This week on Pitch & Play we break our format yet again to talk more about *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of Kingdom* because it's our podcast and we make the rules, OK? Cassie and Ross invite special guest Joe, known *Breath of the Wild* fan, to gush about Nintendo's latest release and how we just want to spend all of our time in the depths. Cassie closes the episode by pitching yet another banger to Ross, *The Sims Bustin' Out* for GBA, which he is sure to like and enjoy.
