This episode of Pitch & Play covers *Rise of the Tomb Raider*, the second game in the Tomb Raider "Survivor Trilogy." Cassie and Ross review the at times incoherent (but nevertheless entertaining) narrative, gameplay loop, and expansive side content. Cassie then recommends a game to Ross for our next episode: *Tony Hawk's American Wasteland*.
