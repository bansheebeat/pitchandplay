This week on Pitch & Play, Ross follows through on Cassie's recommendation to play the beleaguered PlayStation 4 exclusive *The Order 1886*. The two discuss the potential in the premise of the game, its incredible graphics (that still hold up in 2023!), and ultimate failure to deliver a satisfying end product. The episode concludes with Ross's pitch to Cassie for the next episode, *Rise of the Tomb Raider*, the second game in the Tomb Raider "Survivor Trilogy."
