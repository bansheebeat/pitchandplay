We're back! After a missed week due to Lifeâ„¢, Cassie and Ross sit down to discuss *The Sims Bustin' Out* on the GameBoy Advance, a childhood favorite of Cassie's! They focus on the design of the game, how the developers met the challenge (or didn't meet) of adapting a PC game to a handheld format, and the general hilarity of the dialogue and storytelling.

We do not have a pitch attached to this episode as Cassie is still working on Dragon Age! You can hear her thoughts on the first third of the game [on a previous episode](https://pitchandplay.org/dragon-age-origins-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/).
